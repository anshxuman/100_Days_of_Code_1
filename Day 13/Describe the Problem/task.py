# Describe the Problem - Write your answers as comments:

# 1. What is the for loop doing? -
# it's trying to print "You got it" when the value of i becomes 20, which will never become
# 20 bcause its starting from 1 and ending at 19


# 2. When is the function meant to print "You got it"?
# when i == 20

# 3. What are your assumptions about the value of i?
# i won't be 20, we need to make this loop run till 21
